I love reading because it transports me to a different world and makes me use my imagination.\n\n\n\n\nReading\n\n\n\nMy second favorite hobby is making pinterest boards. I think I am pretty good at this but I suppose that is subjective. I love doing this because I come across a lot of interesting images and it also helps me to plan things out and put my ideas into a visual format.\nMy third favorite hobby is embroidery. I am not very good at this hobby but I enjoy it very much because it is therapeutic."
