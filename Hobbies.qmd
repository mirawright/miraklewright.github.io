1. My top favorite hobby is reading. These days I don't have much time to read recreational, I read mostly for my classes, but when I do read recreationally it's very relaxing. I love reading because it transports me to a different world and makes me use my imagination.

2. My second favorite hobby is making pinterest boards. I think I am pretty good at this but I suppose that is subjective. I love doing this because I come across a lot of interesting images and it also helps me to plan things out and put my ideas into a visual format. 

3. My third favorite hobby is embroidery. I am not very good at this hobby but I enjoy it very much because it is therapeutic.
